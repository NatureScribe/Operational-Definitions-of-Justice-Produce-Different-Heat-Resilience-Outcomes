# Operationalizing-Justice-in-Heat-Resilience-Building-Projects
This repository provides codes to compute statistical measures, distribution graphs, and deviations from justice (as detailed in the paper "Operationalizing Justice in Heat Resilience Building Projects"). Deviations are processed in Excel to calculate percentage differences and then input into ArcGIS for visualization.

## Dataset Instructions

The dataset has been split into smaller parts due to file size limitations on GitHub. The files include:
- `MB_Integrated_Dataset_Unfiltered.Z01`
- `MB_Integrated_Dataset_Unfiltered.Z02`
- `MB_Integrated_Dataset_Unfiltered.zip`

### Steps to Use the Dataset:
1. Download all parts (`.Z01`, `.Z02`, `.zip`) from the repository.
2. Ensure all parts are stored in the same folder.
3. Use [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract:
   - Right-click on `MB_Integrated_Dataset_Unfiltered.zip` and select **Extract Here** or **Extract to [folder name]**.
   - The tool will automatically combine the split parts and extract the dataset.

### Notes:
- All parts (`Z01`, `Z02`, etc.) are required for successful extraction.
- If extraction fails, verify that all parts have been downloaded and placed in the same folder.
